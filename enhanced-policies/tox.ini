# However, if you feel strongly about it, patches will be accepted to fix them
# if they fix ALL of the occurances of one and only one of them.
# H238 New Style Classes are the default in Python3
# H4 Are about docstrings and there's just a huge pile of pre-existing issues.
# W503 Is supposed to be off by default but in the latest pycodestyle isn't.
#      Also, both openstacksdk and Donald Knuth disagree with the rule. Line
#      breaks should occur before the binary operator for readability.
