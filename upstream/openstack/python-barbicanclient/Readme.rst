This repo is for https://opendev.org/openstack/python-barbicanclient

Changes to this repo are needed for StarlingX and those changes are
not yet merged.
Rather than clone and diverge the repo, the repo is extracted at a particular
git SHA, and patches are applied on top.

As those patches are merged, the SHA can be updated and the local patches removed.
